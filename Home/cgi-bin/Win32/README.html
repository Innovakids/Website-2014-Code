<H3>Brief Overview</H3>
Win32::SqlServer is a module that permits you to access <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server from Perl, by
using any of the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">OLE DB</SMALL> providers <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQLOLEDB</SMALL> or <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Native Client.
Win32::SqlServer exposes
two levels of interface, a high-level interface and a mid-level interface. The
high-level interface is a developed version of the interface of my older module
<SMALL CLASS="allcaps">MSSQL</SMALL>::Sqllib, and largely backwards compatible with this interface. The
mid-level interface exposes a few more knobs at the price of somewhat more
verbose code. A special feature of Win32::SqlServer is that you get fine-grained control for error handling.<P>There is no support for <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">DBI</SMALL>. This module does not
   run on Unix &#8211; or any other non-Windows OS for that matter.</P>
<H3>What&#39;s in This Kit</H3>
The zip file includes x86 and AMD64 binaries for ActivePerl builds 820 and1002. 
The binaries should work with other 8xx builds from 809 and up, and for later 
10xx builds, as long as ActiveState does not introduce any incompatible changes. 
The kit also includes source
code and test scripts. If you want to run this on Itanium, you will
either have to use the x86 binary, or try to build from sources. (Note that I in
lieu of hardware do not claim to support Itanium.) For information on how to build from sources, see below. <P>The binaries were built on Windows
   Vista with the Visual Studio 2008 C++ compiler and builds 820 and 1002 of ActivePerl.</P>

<H3>Prerequisites</H3>
<UL>
<LI> Perl 5.8.3 or later. (That is ActivePerl build 809 or later.)</LI>
<LI> Windows NT4 SP6, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2003, Windows Vista and 
Windows 2008.</LI>
<LI> <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server 6.5 or later.</LI>
<LI> <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">MDAC</SMALL> 2.6 or <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> 
Server Native Client.</LI>
</UL>

<P>For details, see the <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#Prerequisites">Prerequisites</A>
   section in the Win32::SqlServer manual.</P>

<H3>How to Install the Binary</H3>
<UL>
<LI> Extract the zip file anywhere you like.
</LI>
<LI>Open a Command Prompt, and change directory to where you extracted the
   files.
</LI>
<LI>Run the script <B>activeperl-copy.pl</B>. This script inspects your <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">PATH</SMALL> to
   determine where your Perl installation is, and installs the files according
   to the structure used by ActivePerl.
</LI>
<LI>You can prevent the script from searching by giving the top directory for
   your Perl installation yourself. E.g.:

<PRE>    perl activeperl-copy.pl C:\Perl</PRE></LI>
</UL>

<P>To test that the installation is OK, either run any of the test scripts that
   comes with Win32::SqlServer and which are detailed in <A HREF="Tests.html">tests.html</A>,
   or run any of the <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#quickexamples">sample scripts</A>
   in the manual.</P>
<H3>Manual</H3>
<P>The manual is in <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html">Win32-SqlServer.html</A>.
   activeperl-copy.pl also installs it as html/<SMALL CLASS="allcaps">site/lib/</SMALL>Win32/SqlServer.html&nbsp;
   There is a <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">POD</SMALL> file as well, but there is no real contents in it, only a
   pointer to the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">HTML</SMALL> file.</P>
<H3>Reporting Bugs or Problems</H3>
<P>Please mail bug reports and suggestions to <A HREF="mailto:esquel@sommarskog.se">
esquel@sommarskog.se</A>. Try to make your reports as specific as possible.
Particularly do not forget to include which versions of Perl, Windows, <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server
etc you are using.</P>
<P>
I usually try to respond within 24-48 hours, but if I am on holiday I am.</P>
<H2><A NAME="build_src">Building from Sources</A></H2>
<H3>Prerequisites</H3>
<P>To build Win32::SqlServer you need:</P>
<UL>
<LI> The Platform <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SDK</SMALL> for Windows, more
   precisely, the Core <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SDK</SMALL> and the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">MDAC SDK</SMALL>.
   The Platform <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SDK</SMALL> comes with Visual Studio. You can
   also download the 
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=F26B1AA4-741A-433A-9BE5-FA919850BDBF&amp;displaylang=en">Windows SDK for Windows Server 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5</A>. 
(The link is the current as of this writing. Microsoft often twitches things 
around, so you have to search for it.)</LI>
<LI> The SDK (header files and link libraries) for SQL Server Native client that comes with SQL 2008. (The SDK for SQL 
2005 won&#39;t do.) </LI>
<LI> Perl 5.8.3 or later.</LI>
<LI>
    <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">A C</SMALL>++ compiler, preferably Visual C++ 8.0 or later. (The C++ compiler that
   comes with Visual Studio&nbsp;6 will <B>not</B> work.) If you don&#39;t have 
	Visual Studio, the Windows SDK (see above), comes with one.</LI>
<LI> A make facility. Microsoft&#39;s <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">NMAKE</SMALL> also 
comes with the Windows SDK.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>How to Build and Install</H3>
<P>Text in <KBD>this type face</KBD> indicates command you run from the command
prompt.</P>
<OL TYPE=1>
<LI>Extract the zip file anywhere you like.</LI>
<LI>Edit <B>makefile.pl</B> so that <CODE>$SQLDIR</CODE> points to where <B>sqlncli.h</B> is
   located.</LI>
<LI>If you use a different compiler from Visual C++, you need to review 
makefile.pl more closely. <B>makefile.pl</B> includes two linker options 
specifed with <I>dynamic_lib</I> option that are likely to work only with Visual C++.
<B>/base</B> is only there to set a difference base address for better startup 
performance. <B>/delayload</B> is more important: it defers the loading of 
sqlncli10.dll until it&#39;s actually needed, or more precisely until you call 
OpenSqlFilestream. Without /delayload, Win32::SqlServer would not run on systems 
without SQL Server Native Client 10. If you use a different compiler than VC++, 
this is something you need to address.</LI>
<LI>Note that <B>makefile.pl</B> explicitly lists which libraries to link with,
   and specifies the MT flag for the C compiler. This is to force use of the
   static C run-time library for Visual C++, which is what I want for the binary
   distribution. Change this if you like.</LI>
<LI>Open a Command Prompt, and change directory to where you extracted the
   files.</LI>
<LI><KBD>Perl makefile.pl</KBD>. </LI>
<LI><KBD>MAKE</KBD><BR/>Or <KBD>NMAKE</KBD>, <KBD>DMAKE</KBD> or whatever your
   <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">MAKE</SMALL> utility you use.</LI>
<LI><KBD>MAKE test</KBD><BR/>
    Before you run the tests, please read <B><A HREF="Tests.html">tests.html</A></B>
   so that you understand what impact the test scripts have on your server. This
   document also describes how to set the environment variable <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">OLLEDBTEST</SMALL>, from
   which the test scripts get information how to log into <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server.</LI>
<LI><KBD>MAKE install</KBD></LI>
